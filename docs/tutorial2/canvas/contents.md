Telekit Canvas is a **visual mode** for building Telegram bots directly inside **Obsidian** — a free note-taking app that supports node-based canvas diagrams.

Instead of writing code for every dialog step, you design your bot as a **flowchart**: nodes become messages, arrows become buttons.

> [!NOTE]
> Telekit Canvas uses **Telekit DSL** under the hood — your canvas is automatically converted to a DSL executable model at runtime.
