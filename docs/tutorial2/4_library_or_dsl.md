# Python, Telekit DSL or Canvas?

At this point, you’ve learned enough to start exploring **Telekit DSL** — a custom language used to create interactive bots.  

Alternatively, you can stay on the **classic Telekit path** and continue learning the standard, Python-first way of building bots.

> Choose the direction that best fits how you want to build your bot.

> [!TIP]
> You can always combine both approaches: use **Telekit DSL** for dialogs and **Telekit** for complex logic.

## 🧑‍💻 Continue with classic Telekit

- **API Coverage:** `Full`
- **Difficulty:**   `Advanced`

If you want to keep working directly with the **Telekit Python API**, this path is for you.

- [Continue with classic Telekit (Next: Senders) »](5_senders.md)

## 🧙‍♀️ Switch to Telekit DSL

- **API Coverage:** `Partial`
- **Difficulty:**   `Intermediate`

Telekit DSL is a **declarative language** for building dialog flows without writing Python logic for every step.

## 🏞️ Switch to Telekit Canvas (BETA)

- **API Coverage:** `Basic`
- **Difficulty:**   `Beginner`

Telekit Canvas lets you build dialog flows **visually** in Obsidian — no code required for every step.
