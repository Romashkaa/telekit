# Telekit or Telekit DSL?

At this point, you’ve learned enough to start exploring **Telekit DSL** — a custom language used to create interactive bots.  

Alternatively, you can stay on the **classic Telekit path** and continue learning the standard, Python-first way of building bots.

> Choose the direction that best fits how you want to build your bot.

> [!TIP]
> You can always combine both approaches: use **Telekit DSL** for dialogs and **Telekit** for complex logic.

## Continue with classic Telekit

If you want to keep working directly with the **Telekit Python API**, this path is for you.

## Switch to Telekit DSL

Telekit DSL is a **declarative language** for building dialog flows without writing Python logic for every step.
